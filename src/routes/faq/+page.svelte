<blockquote>The group <a href="https://noai.school" target="_blank">noai.school</a> is a parent initiative worth looking into.

It's worth understanding the fundamental reality that AI is not actually beneficial for learning. It has been repeatedly shown to not be helpful and actually damage student problem solving ability.<br>
<a href="http://archive.today/LjPyo" target="_blank">AI's training has been shown to be incredibly damaging</a> to those who worked on it. There is also a severe environmental cost: some back of the napkin math suggests that a single planned AI datacentre will use more electricity yearly than the city of San Fransisco (<em>Empire of AI by Karen Hao</em>), producing a strong argument for environmentalists to want to avoid AI entirely.<br>
Microsoft is an American company, and American companies must comply with US data law, meaning <a href="https://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-science/microsoft-says-u-s-law-takes-precedence-over-canadian-data-sovereignty/article" target="_blank">the US has full access to all student data collected by Microsoft</a>.
