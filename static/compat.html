    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>AI is Destroying the Environment.</b> AI data-centers in developing areas are destroying communities, ecosystems, and resource supplies in developing nations, creating damages too vast to recount here. Further reading in <em>Empire of AI</em> by Karen Hao if you'd like to hear more on the subject.</li>
        <li><b>AI isn't Beneficial to Learning.</b> Copilot AI (Microsoft's rebranding of ChatGPT) will be implemented inside of software like Microsoft Word next year, meaning soon you'll be able to cheat on your homework and never need to open a new tab. It goes without saying, but that isn't amazing for our ability to learn.</li>
