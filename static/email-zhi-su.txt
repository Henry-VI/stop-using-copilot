This is the email sent to my younger brother in response to the email generated on the main page of this website.



Dear ||||||,

I had the pleasure of meeting your brother at Hamber and appreciated his participation in the event. Like I said to him, there is alway space for ideas and perspectives and it's important to feel heard as well as to challenge ideas with respect recognizing that different people will approach different topics and ideas from varying angles. 
Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughtful feedback and concerns regarding Microsoft 365 Copilot. Your perspective is important, and we appreciate your commitment to privacy, security, and the integrity of learning.
We want to assure you that Microsoft is a trusted partner in education, and its solutions are widely recommended by the Ministry of Education and Child Care. In fact, every school district in the province and most independent school use Microsoft services. Microsoft 365 Copilot is designed with enterprise-grade security and compliance standards, including encryption of data at rest and in transit, adherence to GDPR, and strict privacy controls. Importantly, Copilot does not use school or student data to train AI models, and all data remains within the district's secure Microsoft 365 environment. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/enterprise-data-protection
Copilot's purpose is to enhance learning and productivity, not replace it. Educators have full control over how these tools are implemented, and features can be adjusted to align with academic integrity and classroom needs. If you prefer not to use AI features, you may opt out, and your teacher will accommodate your choice to ensure you can complete your work without Copilot. Some teachers have also voiced their position and will not be using AI in their classrooms-it is ultimately up to the teacher to decide.
It's also important to note that the Vancouver School Board is not leading this area. In fact, some districts such as Coquitlam, West Vancouver, Abbotsford, Surrey, and Richmond have already deployed Microsoft 365 Copilot for students or other platforms of AI. We are following the same timeline as Langley, Burnaby, and Sea to Sky school districts and we regularly liaise with their respective departments.
Finally, while we respect individual choices, it is worth noting that many universities-including UBC-are integrating AI into their programs, and numerous industries rely on AI to remain competitive. Our goal is to prepare students for a future where these tools are becoming commonplace, while ensuring equity, safety, and responsible use. I have two children at UBC and both are using AI supported by their professors and leveraging it to study. There are also cutting edge research supporting the use of AI in their respective fields of study and eventual career paths.
Thank you again for raising these important points. Your voice helps us make informed decisions that prioritize safety, equity, and learning outcomes. I also note that you are using an iOS device. All Apple devices within the past two years have chatGPT integrated, and all cellphones have AI features and function baked into their devices and operating systems. AI is not a new thing and it is not something that is going to disappear or stop iterating, but we have the ability to control our own use and action our beliefs - I believe you and Henry are doing just that and I applaud you on your conviction, but just like the panel of students discussing their use of social media. Don't shame them for using social media - just like don't shame them for using AI. People have the right to choose.
We have taken more time than other districts to meet with a working group, solicited feedback from parents, teachers, and students, and feel good about providing students with a safer alternative to consumer level platforms. Even if you and your brother are not accessing AI, we know the students are. More than half of the student forum group were for the use of AI and are using AI that have no guardrails. So, it is our obligation to provide a safer alternative and weave in education.
Once again, thank you for taking the time to reach! Your feedback is valued and noted.
Best regards,

Zhi Su (he/him)
